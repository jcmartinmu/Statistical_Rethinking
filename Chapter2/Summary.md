# Small Worlds and Large Worlds

The **small world** is the self-contained logical world of the model. Within the small world, all possibilities are nominated. 

In contrast, the **large world** is the broader context in which one deploys a model. In the large world, there may be events that were not imagined in the small world. Moreover, the model is always an incomplete representation of the large world, and so will make mistakes, even if all kinds of events have been properly nominated.
* The logical consistency of a model in the small world is no guarantee that it will be optimal in the large world.

## Building a Model

### A data story

Bayesian data analysis usually means producing a story for how the data came to be. This story may be:
* **Descriptive:** specifies associations that can be used to predict outcmes, given observations. 
* **Causal:** presents a theory of how some events produce other events.

All data stories are complete in the sense that they are sufficient for specifying an algorithm for simulating new data. Then, the data story is translated into a formal probability model.
